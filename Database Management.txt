CREATE DATABASE mydata;
CREATE table------the queries you want to write-----
Instead of creating everything in command line prompt I have used Mysql, which is a great way to make tables and access their information.
I have given ID and StudName primary key and everything as VARCHAR for simplicity.
Remember to name the exact same variables in the program and while making table columns.
If you came across any issues notify me :D, Happy learning.
